  Welcome!<br><br>
I'm Ruth, a smart, compassionate individual with a desire to learn and the gumption of a fox. I grew up in Oregon, studied in Los Angeles, wandered the streets of London and perused the parks of Ann Arbor, Michigan before moving to Chicago in July 2013. <br><br>
I've dabbled in the non-profit, publishing and real estate sectors. I've recently put my eye on coding!<br><br>
I enjoy reading, films, travel and bowling.<br><br>
